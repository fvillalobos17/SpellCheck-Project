Read Me - Assign 10 
Felicia Villalobos 

For this assignment I attended TA hours on Thursday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wendesday. 
Overall this assignment was managable, I feel as though the methods were easy to understand and it was very helpful to draw out how each one would change the string. The hardest part of the assignment was fining the dictionary file on my computer. In the end I was unable to find it, and by that time it past TA hours, and it was too late to post on Piazza. I tried usign the redirection tutorial on the class website but then had to prioritize formatting my code and doing my JavaDocs. That is why on my code, the dictionary file is submitted and hardcoded into the program's main function. Other than that, with help from TA's and sitting down to understand the methods and tools needed to complete them like substringing and string building, writing the SpellDictionary class was not horrible and rather logical. 

Run Times: 

HashSet<String>:

ArrayList<String>:

TreeSet<String>:
0.259u 0.025s 0:01.47 18.3%     0+0k 56+64io 0pf+0w


What I can gather from this information I got after running all of the variations in aurora, is that we are using the fastest method to correct the words by using a HashSet.
